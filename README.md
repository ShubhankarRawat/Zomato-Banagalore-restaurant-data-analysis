Bangalore(officially known as Bengaluru) is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Karnataka. 
With a population of over 15 million, Bangalore is the third largest city in India and 27th largest city in the world.

Bangalore has a unique food culture. Restaurants from all over the world can be found here in Bengaluru, with various kind of cuisines.
Some might even say that Bangalore is the best place for foodies.

The growing number of restaurants and dishes in Bangalore is what attracts me to inspect the data to get some insights, some interesting facts and figures.
So, in this project I will be analyzing the Zomato restaurant data for the city, Bangalore.
